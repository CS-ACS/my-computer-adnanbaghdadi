## Commentary

* My relationship with this computer:

I have had this computer for 5 years, since 2016. I love this computer because it has a lot of highschool memories imbedded into it, not only that but I feel very comfortable with this computer because of how long we have been together. That being said, I have a feeling our time has come to an end. My battery life barely lasts two hours of straight work, and a good chunk of my keys don't work anymore.

* Computer Performance:

I think that this computer has very good capabilities, and even after five years of heavy usage I still have 200 GB of internal storage and it usually runs very smoothly. My laptop's performance has always been very smooth, although when I have lots of tabs open and I am running a high capacity video game, my laptop will lag and stall. This makes sense considering it only has 8 GB of ram, whereas the newer versions have as much as 32 GB of RAM. I like how thin my laptop is, but, since it is so thin there are only 4 USB-C ports. Taking that into consideration, if I want to project my laptop to a moniter via HDMI I need to use a dongle, which can be annoying at times.
